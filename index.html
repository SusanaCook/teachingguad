    <h1>LMAO Guad doesn't know how to code!</h1>
    <p>
        We literally stood there and fought about who was paying. Two days 
        in a row this happened. And also he insulted my ex <3 <br>
        Don't get my hopes up, he's still Mari's brother <br>
        I do really like him though. I was their house last 
        night in his room playing UNO until half past eight, 
        the only decent thing and when I said I wanted to not 
        be at home for as long possible, he kept me out until 
        half past five. He also has really nice eyes <br>
